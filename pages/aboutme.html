	<h1 class="grid3">All about Mr. Wright</h1>
	<div class="grid2">
	<h2>Mr. Wright is a nerd</h2>  
	Playing video games, reading fantasy novels (not the ones women read...), participating in the occasional D&amp;D session, wasting time programming, trying to keep up with everything Magic: the Gathering, tinkering with computers, and caffeinating are among my hobbies
	(usually a good, black cup of coffee does the trick, but if I'm feeling particularly nostalgic or spendy, I'll reach for a Bawls or Red Bull).  
	It would also be good for you to keep in mind that parenthetical statements are a key method I employ in expressing myself.</div>
	
	<div class="grid2"><h2>March of the Machines</h2>
	
		Technology has been a major part of my life since my parents purchased their first computer in the mid-late '90's.
		My interest in computers was entirely recreational until I reached high school, however.
		What really piqued my interest in pursuing a career in technology was a kid I knew in middle school who programmed computer games, which was my first exposure to coding of any kind and the idea of it fascinated me.  
		Some of my time in high school was spent learning to diagnose computer problems, program using C++, and learning Microsof Office software (you see, my high school was a technology magnet).
		My first love, however, was programming.  
		I entered the University of Louisville believing wholeheartedly that I wanted to be a programmer for the rest of my life.
	</div>
	
	<div class="grid2"><h2>Ascending Mount Doom</h2>
		Doubts crept in when I got into my second year of Computer Engineering and Computer Science.  
		One of the classes required for my major was Information Structures.  
		The class bored me to tears and the assignments gave me nightmares.  
		I felt like I was in over my head.  I also got tired of the math.
		Calculus class was nearly impossible, particularly with the toughest duo in the history of college-level calculus: Drs. Tyler and Ralston.  
		The Duo of Doom.  
		Adept at both chalk and eraser use, the pair would write with one hand while erasing with the other.  
		I was sick of it, so I gave up on computer engineering and found a new passion: biology.
		<br>
		Now, anyone who truly knew how much I hated biology in high school would do a double-take if they found out I completed a Bachelor of Science in Biology.  
		As it turns out, my hatred of biology had more to do with the students than it did anything else (well... that and the dissections... yuck! fetal pig juice).

	<div class="grid2"><h2>Here Comes the Plot Twist</h2>
	
	Being out of school for some time now, and being unable to find jobs other than those that are part-time, dead-end, or both has led me on a bit of a journey to expand my skillset.  A good friend of mine in college, someone who was much better at programming than I, got into
	a programming language called Python.  Well, with all the free time I have had over the past couple of years in between jobs, I have picked up some rudimentary Python skills myself.
	More recently, I have also picked up some HTML and CSS skills through a little experiment created through Louisville Works called Code Louisville.  Everything on this site was designed by yours truly, though I did borrow some inspiration from various places.  The class, if you are curious, involves gathering together a bunch of
	people of like mind in their desire to learn how to code websites, give them FREE access to excellent curriculum (<a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com" title="Team Treehouse">http://www.teamtreehouse.com</a>) through the Louisville Free Public Library, and provide instructors
	who are in the web design industry.</div>
	
	<div class="grid2">
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		As of this writing (12/31/13), I am available for both hire and freelance work.  If you would like more information about my skillset, would prefer a more formal resume, or have another pressing reason to contact me, fill out <a href="aboutme_form.php" title="form">my form</a> 
		and I will get back to you in due course.
